# Make Quantum Processing Units better â€“ with KQCircuits and IQM Quantum Computers

## Challenge

In order to obtain a quantum advantage over classical computers, humanity will need to scale up quantum computers from their current 2 to 3 digit qubit counts up to tens or hundreds of thousands. Building quantum computers with superconducting circuits is one of the most popular methods. A couple of challenges need to be considered to increase the number of qubits in superconducting circuits while maintaining connectivity or the ability to perform operations. Where to put all those (and there are a lot of them) connecting wires? How to incorporate large components like readout resonators into the layout? How to maintain distance between qubits to minimize interference? Can you come with any smart multiplexing scheme for reading out or controlling qubits?
In this challenge, you will explore how to scale from 5 to 50 qubits and more. Think of ways to increase the qubit count, maintain connectivity, etc., and solve one of the greatest challenges in quantum computing. To give you a jump start on superconducting chip design, you will be able to attend a workshop on how to design your own chip with KQCircuits. Consider aesthetics, size, and feasibility while using KQCircuits as a tool for your design.
Take up this challenge to create the quantum computer of the future that is prepared for the challenges to come! Happy hacking!

## What do I have to do before the workshop?

Check the [`preparation`](preparation.md) note for things to do or install before starting the challenge.

# How can we submit an idea?

Open an issue using the following template:

```
### Team name
Schroedinger's cats

### Team members
Erwin Schroedinger, Ada Lovelace, Max Planck

### Idea description
Please try to summarise your idea here
```

Don't worry if your team is not complete yet. Hackathons are a great way to meet new people :-)

# How to get support?

There will be a 2h workshop on Saturday morning, where you will learn all the things you need to know to solve this challenge. IQMers will also guide and advice your team with its project. We are also happy to stay in contact with you after the hackathon, if you want to bring your idea further.

# How to submit our work?

If you have used the GUI version, make a pull request to the challenge repository and reference your issue in your pull request.
If you have worked with KQCircuits developer version, please publish your forked repository to Github, create a pull request and link it inside the issue you created within the hackathon repository.
By submitting your work, you agree that you share it under the [GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE](LICENSE).

If you have never done a pull request or published changes, we are happy to help you!

# Judging criteria

The submissions will be judged on different criteria. As we want to have fun at this hackathon, we value the overall concept and the aesthetics more than technical feasibility.

- aesthetics (50%),
- size (20%),
- and feasibility (3\*10%; readout, single-qubit-gates, two-qubit-gates).

# Hackathon Schedule

For the schedule, please check the official homepage.
