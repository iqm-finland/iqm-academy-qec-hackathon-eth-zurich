# Make Quantum Processing Units better â€“ with KQCircuits and IQM Quantum Computers

## Challenge

In order to obtain a quantum advantage over classical computers, humanity will need to scale up quantum computers from their current 2 to 3 digit qubit counts up to tens or hundreds of thousands. Building quantum computers with superconducting circuits is one of the most popular methods. A couple of challenges need to be considered to increase the number of qubits in superconducting circuits while maintaining connectivity or the ability to perform operations. Where to put all those (and there are a lot of them) connecting wires? How to incorporate large components like readout resonators into the layout? How to maintain distance between qubits to minimize interference?
In this challenge, you will explore how to scale from 5 to 50 qubits and more. Think of ways to increase the qubit count, maintain connectivity, etc., and solve one of the greatest challenges in quantum computing. To give you a jump start on superconducting chip design, you will be able to attend a workshop on how to design your own chip with KQCircuits. Consider aesthetics, size, and feasibility while using KQCircuits as a tool for your design.
Take up this challenge to create the quantum computer of the future that is prepared for the challenges to come! Happy hacking!
